/* 1000proxy â€“ Filament Panels Custom Theme (Tailwind v4, CSS-first)
   This file aggregates your existing custom theme CSS and ships it only on Filament pages.
   It keeps Filament v4's native theme while restoring your prior look & components.

   - We deliberately DO NOT override Filament's CSS here; these rules are additive.
   - Global selectors in imported files only apply on Filament pages because we include this CSS
