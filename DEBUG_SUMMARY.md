# üéâ 1000proxy Project Debug & Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed ‚úÖ

### 1. **XUIService Method Name Mismatch**
- **Issue**: Server model was calling `getInbounds()` method which didn't exist
- **Fix**: Changed to `listInbounds()` method which is the correct method name in XUIService
- **File**: `app/Models/Server.php` line 208

### 2. **Carbon DateTime Method Issues**
- **Issue**: Several datetime columns were calling non-existent methods like `isFuture()`, `diffInMinutes()`, and `toISOString()`
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - `isFuture()` ‚Üí `> now()` comparison
  - `toISOString()` ‚Üí `format('c')` for ISO8601 format
- **Files**: `app/Models/Server.php` lines 363, 540, 541

### 3. **XUIService Constructor Issue**
- **Issue**: XUIService was being instantiated with server ID instead of Server model
- **Fix**: Changed `new XUIService($this->id)` to `new XUIService($this)`
- **File**: `app/Models/Server.php` line 207

### 4. **Auth Facade Missing**
- **Issue**: `Auth::logout()` was not properly imported
- **Fix**: Added `use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;` import
- **File**: `routes/web.php`

### 5. **Frontend Build Configuration**
- **Issue**: package.json had duplicate devDependencies sections causing Vite build failures
- **Fix**: Merged duplicate sections into single configuration
- **File**: `package.json`

### 6. **SCSS Build Issues**
